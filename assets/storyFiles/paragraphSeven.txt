Congratulations, the horde of Koopas ran away and now you're free to explore
the mystic cave. As you look around, you realize that this place has been 
safeguarded by the Kingdom Elders for a very long time. They always talked about 
how there was some sort of powerful item inside the cave; if it got into the wrong 
hands, it could be very dangerous. After a bit more scouting, you discover a shiny, 
spherical object. 'Could this be the powerful item?' you ask yourself. Suddenly, 
some text engraved onto the cave wall starts to glow... It reads 'You have the 
magical fortune orb. Shake it and you will randomly receive a strong power-up that 
will be of great use.'
