Bowser snarls, 'You've been creating a lot of trouble for me but I'll be sure
 to put an end to that soon enough. Right now, you're at the start of my 
'Warp Path,' and I'm waiting for you at the end. 
You have to roll and die and according to that, you'll move forward. 
If you land on certain squares, you'll move forward a few steps closer to me. 
However, if you land on certain other squares, you'll have to move backward. 
On the way, you'll have to answer some mathematics questions to proceed. 
I'll see you at the end, Yoshi.'
