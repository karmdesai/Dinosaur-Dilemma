You entered the cave. Huh? What's this? There seems to be a horde of Koopas 
blocking an object of some sort. 'Hey? Who are you? Scram!' says one of the Koopas. 
You refuse to leave and so they challenge you to a duel. 
In order to defeat them, you'll have to answer 3 math questions in a row! 
If you get one wrong, you'll have to start over... 
Ready? Go!
