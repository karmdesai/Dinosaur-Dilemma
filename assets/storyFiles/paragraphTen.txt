You swallow a Koopa shell, and that allows you to fly (since you're a Blue Yoshi). 
You fly over your kingdom and see Koopas acting aggressively; they're capturing citizens 
and taking over various spots. 'What can we do?' you ask Mario. 
'Hmm... I see the airship ahead. Let's go there and check it out!' he says. 
You keep flying and eventually dive down into the airship. After walking around a bit, 
you feel that the airship is abandoned. 'That's strange. There are so many Koopas outside 
but none of them are guarding the airship...' you tell Mario. He responds with 
'This place is eerie...' and you keep walking.
