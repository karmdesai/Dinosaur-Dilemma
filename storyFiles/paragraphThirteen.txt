Suddenly, you spot a Magikoopa flying above you! 
'Swish... Swish...' The Magikoopa waves his wand. 
'What is that?' you ask Mario. 'I don't know, but it certainly can't be a good thing!' 
You are affected by the Magikoopa's spell and find yourself on the floor. You dust 
yourself off and immediately realize that you're in what seems to be like a dungeon.
