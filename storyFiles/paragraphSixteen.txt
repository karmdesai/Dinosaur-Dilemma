Bowser says 'I see that you're here, Yoshi. No more wasting time, 
let's get right into it. I have five lives. You'll have to answer some multiple
choice trivia questions. If you get a question right, I will lose one life. 
However, if you incorrectly answer even one question, YOU will all your lives!' 
This is your final challenge... 
Are you ready? Go!
