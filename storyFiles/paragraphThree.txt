A few moments later, a large airship swoops down and suddenly 'Koopas' are 
roaming around the street! You quickly hide behind a bush in fear, but your 
friend is not so lucky. 'HELP!' he screams as the Koopas drag him away. 
'Surrender! Surrender! Sir Bowser, the King Koopa, wants us to take over the 
Dinosaur Kingdom!' the Koopas shout. You barely escape the Dinosaur Kingdom, 
but you feel that it's your duty to save your friends and family.
