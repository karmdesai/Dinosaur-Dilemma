Like any other day, you are on your way to Dinosaur School. 
You're excited to go to school today because your teacher, Mister C, 
is going to teach you about programming in Java! While you're walking, 
you notice an object in the sky. You ask your best friend, who's walking 
beside you, 'Do you see that? In the air?' He responds with 'Hmm... I don't
see anything. Maybe you're just sleep deprived.' 
Since you agree with him, you keep walking.
